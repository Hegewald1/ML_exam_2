A) Getting to know the data and the problem.
What kind of machine learning problem are we talking about in this exercise? Be as precise as
possible.How many different features (not counting labels (y-values) as a feature here) are there in
this dataset? How many of these features would the Y-data (the labels) consist of?

We are trying to investigate and predict whether a student would complete or not complete their education.
Amount of features: 5 - Line, Grade, Age, Distance and studygroup
Y-data (labels): 1 - Churn

B) Cleaning the data
You have to decide on which of the features for the X training dataset you want to use and then later
what to do with missing data for the features you keep.

Dropped the Id column, changed Churn values to 1 or 0, changed Line (EUX, HHX etc.) to numerical values

C) Choosing a model and doing training. Evaluate performance on test set.
Choose a model for doing training and explain your reason for this choice. Train the model using
the training data. Evaluate performance. Can you predict churn, yes/no? How well?

StudentChurn.py contains both model for neural net and decision tree
Reason: can not explain why
Evaluate performance:
